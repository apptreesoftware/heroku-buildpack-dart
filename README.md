# Heroku Buildpack: Dart

This is a Heroku buildpack for [Dart][].

This buildpack requires that you use the
[Cedar-14][cedar14] (Ubuntu 14.x-based) stack for your Heroku application.
If your Heroku app runs on previous versions of Cedar, see below for more info.

## Features

* Runs Dart VM as a server in Heroku's cloud
* Installs packages with [pub][]
* Builds the client app with [pub build][build]
* Cedar 14 (Ubuntu 14) required


## Running on Cedar-10 ?

This buildpack only supports Heroku applications that are running on the
Cedar-14 stack. If your application is running on Cedar-10, you should first
[migrate to Cedar-14][cedar14].

This buildpack should work with Cedar-10, but the developers of this
buildpack do not support Cedar-10.

The Cedar-10 stack on Heroku does not support the Dart SDK by default due
to mismatched glibc versions. If you must remain on the Cedar-10 stack, you
need to provide your own .tar.gz of Dart SDK compiled for Ubuntu 10.04
(Heroku's Cedar stack). Get
[instructions for building Dart for Ubuntu 10.04][buildforubuntu] or you can try
using an (unsupported) [community build of Dart for Ubuntu 10.04][communitybuilds].

## Getting Started

(These instructions assume you have the
[heroku tools](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) and
[git](http://git-scm.com/) installed, and that you have a heroku
account.)

Create a Heroku app with the _cedar-14_ stack, specify both this buildpack and a
[URL that points to a compiled Dart SDK][download].

Here is a set of commands that deploys a minimal HTTP server built with Dart
to Heroku:

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/igrigorik/heroku-buildpack-dart.git
$> mkdir myfirstdartappforheroku
$> cp -R heroku-buildpack-dart/test-app/* myfirstdartappforheroku
$> cd myfirstdartappforheroku
$> git init
$> git add -A .
$> git commit -am "first commit"
$> heroku create myfirstdartappforheroku -s cedar-14
$> heroku config:set DART_SDK_URL=<archive url>
$> heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/igrigorik/heroku-buildpack-dart.git
```

Push the app to Heroku. Learn more about [deploying to Heroku with git][deploy].

```bash
$> git push heroku master
```

You may need to scale to one web dyno (aka server):

```bash
$> heroku ps:scale web=1
```

Test your app! The URL is printed at the end of the `git push` step.

## Configuration

### Location of Dart SDK

You must specify a URL that points to a .zip that contains the Dart SDK.
Links to Dart SDKs built for Linux are [available][download].

```bash
$> heroku config:set DART_SDK_URL=<archive url>
```

If you are still running on Cedar-10, you will need to build your own Dart SDK
using the [instructions for building Dart SDK for Ubuntu 10.04][buildforubuntu].

### Specifying the script

The `Procfile` defines the file to run when the application starts. We
recommend to put the server script into your application's `bin/` directory.

The sample app's `Procfile` looks like:

```
web: ./dart-sdk/bin/dart bin/basic_http_server.dart
```

### Overriding the build command

By default `pub build` is launched after `pub get`, it can be useful to use
another command: for instance `pub build --mode=debug` or 
`/app/dart-sdk/bin/dart build.dart`:

```bash
$> heroku config:set DART_BUILD_CMD="/app/dart-sdk/bin/dart build.dart"
```

## Example 

See `test-app` directory for the world simplest Dart web app running on
Heroku.

## Learning more

Dart VM can access files, directories, sockets, HTTP, web sockets, SSL, and
more. See the [dart:io library][io] for core functionality.

Dart's package repository, [pub][], hosts lots of options for more
functionality, such as database drivers, HTTP server frameworks, templates,
and more.
